            '- Every rate pools its actual opportunities and outcomes, rather than averaging players’ percentages weighted by unrelated hand counts. Exported estimates use 100 prior opportunities from the stake pool. The aggregate JSON records denominators, sparse fields and any engine constraints.','- Players need 100 earlier hands to fit/validate types. At publication, players with 100 total eligible hands can be assigned with smoothed estimates; shorter histories remain in Pool. Final production groups refit on all eligible earlier players, then aggregate the complete sample.','- The 3-bet field follows GTOpen’s cold single-raise bucket with no caller ahead. Squeezes are measured separately; this is not necessarily a tracker’s combined 3-bet statistic. Fold-to-3-bet and 4-bet refer to the original raiser. Limp-then-face-raise is separate from cold defense.','- Postflop betting with initiative, betting without initiative and facing-bet decisions have separate denominators. The engine’s donk field pools no-initiative bets/stabs; raises facing bets are pooled across streets. All-in runouts do not generate fictitious checks or betting opportunities.','- Position, stack band, actual occupancy and size-band counters are retained in each public aggregate. Current GTOpen archetype inputs still pool position/stack frequencies and use the engine’s positional shaping.','- `flatten=0` deliberately uses GTO reference hand ordering. Hole-card composition was not fitted; zero is a modeling assumption, not measured intelligence or skill. Shove responses still follow GTOpen’s adaptive large-bet model.','- The current engine can choose only the smallest/largest configured size. The exporter maps the majority opening-size band (up to 2.5bb versus larger) and bet-size band (up to 60% pot versus larger) to those choices. These are approximations, not an exact sizing distribution. Defense bands are floored at the overall 3-bet percentage where the engine requires it; such adjustments are recorded.','- Site population samples are not random censuses. Dealer coverage, observation dates, selection into long histories and unusual-hand exclusions can affect the results. Prediction gains do not establish an exploit EV gain or exact hand ranges.','',
