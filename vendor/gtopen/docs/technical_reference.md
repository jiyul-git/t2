# Technical reference

Engine details, runtime settings, historical benchmarks, and scripting interfaces.
For installation and the app workflow, start with the [README](../README.md).

## Runtime settings

Optional environment:

| var | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | 3737 | HTTP port |
| `SOLVER_THREADS` | physical cores | rayon worker threads (SMT hurts this workload; 12–16 is the sweet spot on a 5950X) |
| `SOLVER_COMPRESS` | 1 | `0` = full-precision f32 arenas instead of 16-bit compressed |
| `SOLVER_GPU` | 1 (if built with `gpu`) | `0` forces the CPU engine even when CUDA is available |
| `SOLVER_GPU_MEM_MB` | live free VRAM − 512 MB | manual VRAM cap for the GPU engine; spots over budget fall back to CPU |
| `SOLVER_MEM_MB` | 80% of free RAM (≤48 GB) | solver-arena + tree RAM budget; bigger builds are refused |
| `PREFLOP_EQ_SAMPLES` | 20000 | Monte-Carlo samples per hand-class pair for the Preflop Lab equity table |
| `PREFLOP_MAX_NODES` | RAM-derived | Preflop Lab tree-size limit; the lab shows a live estimate + this machine's caps before BUILD |
| `PREFLOP_MAX_ARENA_MB` | ~40% of free RAM | Preflop Lab regret/strategy memory limit (MB) |

## Engine

- **Algorithm**: Discounted CFR (α=1.5, β=0, γ=2) with alternating updates,
  vectorized over hands. CFR+ and Predictive CFR+ (PCFR+) are selectable per
  solve (`POST /api/solve {"algorithm": "pcfr+"}` or `SOLVER_ALGO` in the CLI).
- **Compressed arenas (16-bit)**: regrets stored as i16 and strategy
  sums as u16, quantized per node against the node's max magnitude — half the
  memory of f32, and faster on big trees because CFR is memory-bandwidth
  bound. Verified equivalent to f32 within 0.1% pot exploitability by test;
  save files stay full-precision f32 and load into either mode.
- **Zero-allocation traversal**: all per-node-visit scratch vectors come from
  a thread-local buffer pool instead of malloc.
- **CUDA GPU solver**: level-synchronous CFR with f32 working arenas in VRAM
  (`--features gpu`). On the current RTX 3090 benchmarks, the 1.35M-node
  rainbow/two-tone flop cases take **51.8 / 31.4 ms per iteration**.
  Exploitability also runs on the GPU, with reusable evaluation graphs and
  batched root downloads. Node locks, DCFR/CFR+, and both CPU storage modes
  are supported; PCFR+ uses the CPU. Compressed CPU arenas decode on upload
  and re-encode on sync. Visited action blocks are packed where worthwhile,
  value scratch is reused between tree levels, and inactive state is preserved
  for exact save/resume and CPU browsing. The server uses CUDA when available;
  `SOLVER_GPU=0` opts out. The default VRAM budget is **live free VRAM minus
  512 MB headroom**, with `SOLVER_GPU_MEM_MB` as a manual override. The final
  GPU plan is checked at solve time; allocation or CUDA failures fall back to
  CPU. The UI's conservative full-tree estimate can exceed that final plan.
  See [current performance and validation](../research/autoresearch/gpu-pass.md).
- **Terminal evaluation**: O(n) sorted showdown sweep with exact card-removal
  (blocker) accounting via per-card prefix sums; precomputed 7-card strengths
  for every river runout.
- **Exploitability**: true best-response traversal both ways, reported as % of
  pot — a best-response measure for the configured game; locks change the game being evaluated.
- **Parallelism**: rayon across chance branches; arenas use disjoint unsafe
  slices (each tree node's data is touched by exactly one branch).
- **Suit isomorphism**: chance branches that are suit-symmetric (given the
  board and ranges) are solved once and mirrored exactly — ~1.4x on two-tone
  flops, ~2.2x on monotone, no effect on rainbow. Exact (verified against the
  non-isomorphic solver). Zero-reach subtrees are also pruned exactly.
- **Trees**: per-street/per-player bet, raise and (OOP) donk sizes, all-in
  threshold conversion, raise caps, NL min-raise rules, rake (% + cap),
  flop/turn/river root. EVs use the pot-share convention (EV OOP + EV IP =
  pot).
- **Accuracy tests** (`cargo test -p solver --release`): hand evaluator vs an
  independent reference on 20k random deals; range parser round-trips; the
  clairvoyance game converges to its known closed-form solution (bet-ratio
  1/3 bluffs, MDF 50% calls, EVs exact); equity matches brute-force
  enumeration; full flop trees reach <1% pot exploitability; node-lock
  semantics; save/load roundtrip (both storage modes); compressed-vs-f32
  exploitability equivalence; PCFR+ convergence; exploit-view best response
  vs a locked station (bets the nuts, never bluffs, BR EV dominates);
  per-hand locks land on the right combos across suit-isomorphic runouts;
  preflop CFR vs an independent fictitious-play Nash oracle on HU jam/fold,
  plus multiway limp-tree chip conservation and rake-drain direction.

## Preflop continuation model

New preflop games use `coupled_deck_v1` at leaves with **three or more live players**, including all-in showdowns. A deterministic table of 1,024 samples (seed 90210) assigns coupled latent hand strengths. Each sample awards the pot to its winning hand(s), so the players' shares sum to the pot after the configured rake. This replaces the old product of separate heads-up equities, which could substantially undervalue multiway calls.

These latent strengths are an approximation, **not jointly dealt physical hole cards and boards**. Opponent card removal remains approximate: heavily overlapping premium ranges can still produce large errors. Pot conservation and a small best-response gap establish consistency within the configured model; they do not establish accurate real-game equity or a unique multiway Nash strategy.

Multiway leaves use showdown expectation with the requested rake and cap, without a positional realization multiplier or future betting. New UI scenarios select `balanced` for heads-up leaves: relative hand-class priors divide one pot, then the configured rake is deducted explicitly. This is an accounting correction and a new approximation, not a retrained rake-free postflop solver. Legacy `calibrated`, `static`, and `raw` modes remain available; `calibrated` embeds its training rake. [Balanced model, units, and limitations](preflop_balanced_model.md). Neither continuation model solves a full postflop tree during a Preflop Lab solve.

The API identifies the active model as `multiway_equity_model` in build/load responses and session/status readbacks. Existing saves without this field load as `legacy_product`, preserving their payoffs, regrets, and strategy sums. **RE-SOLVE does not migrate a saved game**: save it first, then build and solve a fresh game to use the new model. New coupled-deck files use `GTOPREFLOP2`, so older binaries reject them instead of silently using the wrong payoff model; legacy games continue to save as `GTOPREFLOP1`.

Games with `balanced` realization or separate 4-bet+ menus use `GTOPREFLOP4`, retaining both continuation models and all sizing overrides. Straddle games without those features use `GTOPREFLOP3`. Older binaries refuse unsupported versions.

## Performance

The coupled-deck seven-seat validation game (1,003,570 nodes, 200 bb, RTX
3090) used approximately **13.1 GB VRAM**. A 500-iteration continuation
averaged **4.68 seconds per iteration** (39 minutes in iteration work, plus
accuracy checks and saves). This is substantially more computation than the
legacy product model. GPU scratch batches shrink to fit memory; CPU uses the
same model but large multiway trees are much slower. See the
[validation evidence](../research/multiway-equity-audit/README.md).

Historical performance baseline: **7 September 2026**, Windows, RTX 3090 24 GB,
Ryzen 5950X, 64 GB RAM, 16 solver threads. These are fixed workloads, not a
promise for every tree or machine. These preflop timings predate the coupled-deck model and should not be used as its performance estimate. The comparison below is the GPU
research pass versus fresh controls of the code at the start of that pass.

| Workload | Before | Current | Improvement |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Six-seat preflop, same accuracy target | 3.549 s | 2.317 s | 34.7% less time |
| Eight-seat preflop, same accuracy target | 8.926 s | 5.323 s | 40.4% less time |
| Rainbow flop, 0.3%-pot target | 12.067 s | 11.107 s | 8.0% less time |
| Two-tone flop, 0.3%-pot target | 7.219 s | 6.667 s | 7.6% less time |
| Six-seat preflop GPU allocation | 671 MB | 503 MB | 25.0% less |
| Eight-seat preflop GPU allocation | 1,711 MB | 1,309 MB | 23.5% less |
| Two-tone compressed postflop GPU allocation | 4,933 MB | 3,624 MB | 26.5% less |
| Rainbow compressed postflop GPU allocation | 6,241 MB | 5,906 MB | 5.4% less |
| Warm compressed two-tone full readback | 1,531 ms | 297 ms | 80.6% less time |

Target timings exclude tree construction and initial GPU upload. Preflop
still stops at 175/125 iterations, and the two flop cases at 200/200, with
identical checked states and final values. No precision, model, bet menu,
or accuracy target changed. MB are decimal; device allocations are measured,
while the UI shows estimates and a live memory budget.

The [current GPU report](../research/autoresearch/gpu-pass.md) contains all
comparisons, limitations, and 696 source/numerical audit checks. The
[progress image](../research/autoresearch/gpu-pass-progress.png) renders on GitHub;
the [interactive tracker](../research/autoresearch/index.html) can be opened
locally and includes 130 metric graphs, controls, and rejected trials.

The [first research pass](../research/autoresearch/report.md) additionally covers
CPU solving, profiles, reports, and loading: the measured six-seat CPU
iteration fell from 197.02 to 72.92 ms, report-line summaries from 199.18 to
77.63 ms, and warm f32 save loading from 47.49 to 37.20 ms. These earlier
comparisons have their own baselines; percentages across passes must not be added.
[Preflop](preflop_performance.md) and [postflop](postflop_performance.md)
notes summarize the latest results and preserve the earlier measurements.

RAM budgets cover solver arenas plus tree storage; actual process memory also
includes caches, staging, driver allocations, and other overhead. Compressed
CPU arenas use half the per-entry storage of f32, but do not halve total RAM
or GPU VRAM. The server refuses over-budget CPU trees. GPU packing and scratch
reuse reduce device allocation by different amounts on different trees.

## CLI

```bash
./target/release/solve-cli spot.json [max_iterations] [target_exploit_pct]
./target/release/solve-cli batch spot.json boards.txt [max_iterations] [target]
```

`spot.json` matches the `SpotConfig` JSON schema (see `bench_spot.json`).
Env: `SOLVER_STORAGE=f32|i16` (default i16), `SOLVER_ALGO=dcfr|cfr+|pcfr+`
(default dcfr), `SOLVER_ISO=0`, `SOLVER_THREADS=N`, `SOLVER_GPU=1`
(gpu-feature builds) — all of them apply to every mode (single spot, batch,
realization). Batch rows report range-average root EVs weighted by
reach × valid (the app's convention, so `ev_oop + ev_ip = pot`).

**Batch mode** solves the same ranges/tree across many boards (file with one
board per line, or an inline `b1,b2,..` list), prints one row per board
(iterations, exploitability, reach-weighted root EVs) and writes
`batch_results.json` — the raw material for multi-flop aggregate analysis.
Batch duration depends on each board, ranges, bet menu, target, and any
CPU fallback; the current single-board measurements above are not a full-set ETA. `SOLVER_BATCH_SAVE=1` also
writes `saves/batch_<board>.gto` per board.
